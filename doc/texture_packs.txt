Minetest Texture Pack Reference
===============================

Texture packs allow you to replace textures provided by a mod with your own
textures.

Texture pack directory structure
--------------------------------

    textures
    |-- Texture Pack
    |   |-- screenshot.png
    |   |-- description.txt
    |   |-- override.txt
    |   |-- your_texture_1.png
    |   |-- your_texture_2.png
    `-- Another Texture Pack

### Texture Pack
This is a directory containing the entire contents of a single texture pack.
It can be chosen more or less freely and will also become the name of the
texture pack. The name must not be “base”.

### `description.txt`
A file containing a short description of the texture pack to be shown in the
texture packs tab.

### `screenshot.png`
A preview image showing an in-game screenshot of this texture pack; it will be
shown in the texture packs tab. It should have an aspect ratio of 3:2 and a
minimum size of 300×200 pixels.

### `your_texture_1.png`, `your_texture_2.png`, etc.
Any other PNG files will be interpreted as textures. They must have the same
names as the textures they are supposed to override. For example, to override
the apple texture of Minetest Game, add a PNG file named `default_apple.png`.

The custom textures do not necceessarily require the same size as their
originals, but this might be required for a few particular textures. When
unsure, just test your texture pack in-game.

Texture modifiers
-----------------

See lua_api.txt for texture modifiers

Texture Overrides
-----------------

You can override the textures of a node from a texture pack using
texture overrides. To do this, create a file in a texture pack
called override.txt

Each line in an override.txt file is a rule. It consists of

	nodename face-selector texture

For example,

	default:dirt_with_grass sides default_stone.png

You can use ^ operators as usual:

	default:dirt_with_grass sides default_stone.png^[brighten

Here are face selectors you can choose from:

| face-selector | behavior                                          |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| left          | x-                                                |
| right         | x+                                                |
| front         | z-                                                |
| back          | z+                                                |
| top           | y+                                                |
| bottom        | y-                                                |
| sides         | x-, x+, z-, z+                                    |
| all           | All faces. You can also use '*' instead of 'all'. |
